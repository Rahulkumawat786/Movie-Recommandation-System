# Movie-Recommandation-System
## Introduction
### What is Recommandation system
Recommandation system is simply a filteration programme whose prime goal is to predict "rating" or "prefrences" of a user towards a domain specific item. In my case the domain specific item is movie
### Different filtering strategies -
1. Content based filtering
2. Collabrative filtering
    #### 1. Content based filtering :- 
    This filtering strategy is based on the data provied about the items. The algorithm recommand products that are similar to the ones that a user has liked in past. this similarity (generally cosine similarity) is computed from the data that we have about the items aas well as user past prefrences.
    
    Disadvantages : -
    a. different products do not get much exposure to the user
    b. Businesses can not be expanded as the user does not try different products
